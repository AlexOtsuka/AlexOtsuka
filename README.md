# About me

My name's <strong>Alex</strong>. I'm a self-taught <strong>Programmer</strong> and <strong>Game Developper</strong>.<br>
I'm a fluent :us: english, :jp: japanese, and :fr: french speaker.

### As a teen,
- Got started in my early teens with ActionScript 2.0, for Macromedia Flash MX 2004.
- Soon got into HTML/CSS, PHP and SQL and started building websites from scratch.
- Learned the basics of C and C++, some Object-Oriented Programming concepts, and dabbled in GNU/Linux.
- As I got busier with high school, I spent less and less time on coding.
- Aimlessly became a CS major. Directionless and bored out of my mind, I dropped out after completing year one and acquiring the only ECTS credits I'll ever have to my name.

It's only years after dropping out, by spending time on various passion projects, that my interest for programming was reignited.

### Since my mid 20s,
- Finally taught myself Python and Javascript.
- Took a deep dive and learned the academic side of Data Structures and Algorithms.
- Taught myself C# with an open mind and acquired a deep appreciation for the OOP paradigm.
- Got into Game Development, initially using Unity3D, before switching over to Godot.
- Started contributing to [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
